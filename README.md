So I am trying to store all my python mini projects which I made during learning python.
This project comes at the very beginning of my amazing journey of learning python.

# Email-Sender
Sends email automatically using python code with the help of smtplib module.

In order to generate password for the email id from which email is being sent, do the folowing steps:
(note: for google account, if other account like yahoo,etc are used then steps may differ)
1. Sign in to your google account.
2. Go to "Manage your google account" settings.
3. Select "Security" and click on "App Passwords".
4. Enter your app name and device, select "Generate".
5. Your app specified password is generated. 
(note: turn on 2-step verification in order to make everything work)

Websites like "PythonAnywhere" can be used in order to auto send emails for a scheduled period.
Also, for windows, task scheduler can do the job.
